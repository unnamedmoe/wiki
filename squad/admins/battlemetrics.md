# Battlemetrics Basics
All Bans and Warnings, Kicks should be done within the Battlemetrics System so they are logged. This is not only for accountability, but more for other admins to look at the past record on the player. 
## Warning a Player
1. Click the Player Name 
2. `Warn Player` -> Enter Reason 
3. Execute Warning

There are prebuilt tools for you to utilize: 
* ⚠️ Denotes a Warning Action
* 🥾 Is a Kick 
* 🪲 Is to fix common bugs for players

## Kicking a Player
1. Click the Player Name 
2. `Kick Player` -> Enter Reason 
3. Execute Kick
## Banning a Player 
1. Click the Player Name 
2. `Add Ban`
3. You will be taken to another screen 
- Do not Edit "Banned on Server" 
- You may edit "Ban List", `The Unnamed` is our general ban list, `The Unnamed CBL` is community ban list. Note you MUST have evidence (video, or sufficient logs) to proceed with this
4. Leave all defaults 
5. Duration you can set with the drop down or leave blank for `Forever`
6. Reason: Our template is `Kicked for *PUT_REASON_HERE* | {{timeLeft}} | beunnamed.com`, please **put a reason** in `*PUT_REASON_HERE*`
7. Add any notes, however, we also would prefer notes to be added w/ evidence in #ban-evidence located on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/836985182778556436/995744819295035422)
8. For "Banned Identifiers", please leave the default checked. 
**DO NOT CLICK ANY NAME**
9. Save Ban, the player is now banned for the duration selected

## Broadcasting
Broadcasting is utilizing the Yellow Text for essentially putting a large message on the screen for players to read. 
* To Broadcast, Press Server Commands, Press Broadcast and enter your message
This does not broadcast your name in this message. "Example Broadcast"
* In the overall activity feed, you will see your name. On the right box, you can enter your message
This does broadcast your name in this message. "schmeckles: Example Broadcast" 

## Things Not to Do
There are abilities that you have, in order to react to any scenario as an administrator. However, these are things you should not press. 
* Kill Server: This will kill the server, forcing an auto reboot
* Change Map: Please allow the maps to be voted on or change naturally. 
If you need to change the map, end the current vote with !vote end, end the map using "End Match", then set the next map within seconds
* Raw Command: Do not use unless you know what you're doing 
* Restart Match: This will effectively restart the match, you will kill the server essentially by doing this 
* Add Squad Ban: This is a config ban, do not utilize this. Only utilize the battlemetrics ban tool.
