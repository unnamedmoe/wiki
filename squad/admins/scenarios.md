# Scenarios
Adminning in Squad can normally be a pretty easy task, however, sometimes we're thrown curveballs that you have questions on. So, we'll take those basic scenarios and try and build some understanding.

## Main Camping
Our main camping rules are based on intent and distance. There are some pretty controversial opinions on what "Main Camping" truly is. The Squad Community views main camping with essentially shooting vehicles / enemies leaving a "Fob Creation Marker" sized zone around the enemy main. 

We at The Unnamed view our main camping a bit differently, we wish that all players actively: 
* Play the Active Objectives
* Support the Active Objectives 
* Camp / Do Camping Activities on MSR (main supply roads) that are near active objectives or within 1-2 active objectives 

In this scenario, we have the Canadian main in the red square.
* Camping the red line, or camping in the view of the red line (such as the blue square positioning with view arcs)
* Green Line is allowed transit by the other team 
* Killing enemies as they enter past that or into the red/green intersection would be considered main camping

The fine line that exists in this scenario is the flag to the top left, that area is all free kill zone. This is where admin discretion plays a key part in your decision making. 

> If you believe a player is main camping, utilize the built in warning system to notify them to move.
{.is-warning}

You can utilize the built in warning system by going to battlemetrics:
* Click the Username of the Player in the Dashboard
* Press "Main Camp" and Continue
This will now warn the player to leave the area, in a standardized messaging. 

If the player does not leave the area, please kick them, or utilize 1-14 day ban for main camping depending on the severity. If this is a common occurence with this individual, then you can permanently ban them for the main camping. 

## Asset Claims
One of the most common banning / kick issues on our server, is due to squad name claim violations. There are a few ways to interact with these situations. 

**I made the squad before Jimmy but I am claiming otherwise**
* This is a simple scenario to address, you can just look at the squad creation log in [discord](https://discord.com/channels/836985182778556436/995470444947832882) `logï¸±squads` or battlemetrics main activity log

**I made 30MM Squad, but Timmy made BTR**
* This is simple to address, all acceptable squads names are located in [ðŸ“•ï¸±server-info](https://discord.com/channels/836985182778556436/1063890894455054426)
* In this case, BTR Would have Claim, we do not recognize "30MM" 

**I made BTR80, but Jimmy took BTR82, and I have BTR82!**
* This is simple to address, the squad (Jimmy) taking BTR82 named BTR80 would have to return the asset to BTR82.

**I made BRDM, but Jimmy made BRDM2 after and is claiming it's more accurate!** 
* Really isn't, no one cares. BRDM Squad has claim. Jimmy can kick rocks or get kicked.

If you have any issues, feel free to ask other admins in game or use your discretion. 
> If the player is about to enter a body of water, then you should immediately kick the driver and rest of crew. 
{.is-warning}

You can utilize the built in warning system by going to battlemetrics:
* Click the Username of the Player in the Dashboard
* Press "Claim Issue" and Continue

Or, you can immediately Kick the player, then handle bans after.
