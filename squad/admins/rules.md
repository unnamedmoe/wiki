# General Admin Rules
These are the rules, and general performance categories for our administrators to follow.

## Junior Admin Specific Rules
* Ban Limitation: 3 Days
* Able to do all other duties
* Evidence must be submitted for every ban action, and upgrade must be requested in Ban-Evidence

## All Administrators 
These are rules that all administration staff must follow.
Here's a general summary: 

:small_blue_diamond: Members of the Staff Team shall only take action against a player's account if a sufficient amount of evidence has been collected to eliminate any doubt that a violation of our Server Rules or Terms of Service had occurred
:small_blue_diamond: If you are in a heated discussion with a member of the server, you must ping another admin to handle the situation
:small_blue_diamond: Members of the Staff Team shall, at all times, act in a mature and professional manner. Staff Members shall not appear confrontational or participate in general toxicity
:small_blue_diamond: Members of the Staff Team shall only utilize staff-related permissions and abilities when performing an official staff function. These permissions and abilities are heavily logged and audited to ensure abuse is not occurring within the team
:small_blue_diamond: Members of the staff team should not leak any information that is said in any of the staff channels/ticket channels or tools. Doing so will result in an instant ban.

### Battlemetrics
All Bans and Warnings, Kicks should be done within the Battlemetrics System so they are logged. This is not only for accountability, but more for other admins to look at the past record on the player. 

If you are making your notes on the players in #ban-evidence, please do link the file or ensure the SteamID is in the message so it is searchable.

### Professionalism
Please act professional, remember you are **representing** our community as admins. There are plenty of squad servers out there, our reputation so far is **active administration**, please do not tarnish what we've all worked so hard for. 

:small_blue_diamond: You must act maturely and professionally in-game and on any other Unnamed platforms (Such as discord)
:small_blue_diamond: You must not have any punitive actions on our services
:small_blue_diamond: You must be willing to dedicate at least an hour of your gameplay time, to active administration
:small_blue_diamond: You must have video recording software, this is mandatory
:small_blue_diamond: You need to be able to speak comprehensible english

## In-Game Management
### Admin Squad
If you are rolling just admin duties, please sit in an admin squad, call it whatever you want `admin` `dadmin` `bradmin` `lemonade truck min`. If an `Admin Squad` is active, please do not assume admin duties when they're acting. This is to avoid confusion with our players, and is overall just nice guy kinda material.

### Admin Camera
Please do not abuse the administration camera, for ghosting, cheating or otherwise. If someone is reported or mass teamkilling, no one is going to hate you for investigating. 

### Please be familiar with the server rules, you are enforcing them. 
There may seem like a lot of rules, but with playing 50 hours on our server minimum, you probably know them all. 

### Server Administration Websites 
Squad wants us to monitor players utilizing the Code of Conduct as our policy. Please be sure to familarize yourself with this information in these links.
