### Squad
Squad is a game by OWI (Offworld Industries), and is a action-pact fps built on 50v50 gameplay. 
This requires an active direction, administration, and server moderators to promote the best gameplay experience possible.

We started a Squad Community to build activity, in a game that shares a tactical style gameplay similar to that of Star Citizen's FPS model as well as based on many of our members favourite, Project Reality. Knowing the popularity of this game, and the opportunity to grow our community was obtainable, it was a no brainer. 

The Unnamed runs on a corporate based rank system, this is to ensure efficent command and control of  operations and decision making processes within our corporation.
